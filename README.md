### Hi! I am Benny Istanto üëã

An **agricultural meteorologist** by training and a certified **GIS Professional** (GISP). With over 15 years of experience working with the United Nations and various international organizations, I specialize in integrating advanced GIS modeling with climate technology to drive international development initiatives. My expertise encompasses agricultural climatology, satellite meteorology, simulation modeling, and the application of geospatial information management for natural resource management.

Currently, I serve as a **Climate Geographer** at the Geospatial Operation Support Team (GOST) within the Data Analytics and Tools (DECAT) division, under the Development Economic Data Group (DECDG) at The World Bank, Washington DC. Collaborating with teams across the bank, I offer expertise in geospatial and climate analytics on a global scale. 

I write a blog related to GIS, remote sensing and application to humanitarian activities at https://benny.istan.to/blog, I run a ‚Äúcasual weekend project‚Äù called Climate Social Responsibility (CSR ‚Äì https://benny.istan.to/csr), to provide satellite-based climate and vegetation products for free, i.e. rainfall and anomaly, dry and wet spell, standardized precipitation index, and crop phenology.
